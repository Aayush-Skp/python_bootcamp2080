9. **Switch Between Branches:**
   - Switch to an existing branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout <branch_name>
     ```

10. **Merge Changes:**
    - Merge changes from another branch into your current branch:
      ```bash
      git merge <other_branch_name>
      ```

11. **View Merge Conflicts:**
    - If there are merge conflicts, view them:
      ```bash
      git diff
      ```

12. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:**
    - Manually resolve conflicts in the affected files.
    - After resolving conflicts, add the files and commit the changes.

13. **Delete a Branch:**
    - Delete a branch after merging it or if it's no longer needed:
      ```bash
      git branch -d <branch_name>
      ```

14. **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
    - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
    - Copy the link of the repository.

15. **Link Local Repository to Remote Repository:**
    - Connect your local repository to the remote repository using:
      ```bash
      git remote add origin <repository_link>
      ```

16. **Check Remote Location:**

      ```

17. **Push Files to Remote Repository:**
    - Push your files to the remote repository:
      ```bash
